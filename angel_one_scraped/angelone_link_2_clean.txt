In a 2017 circular on mutual fund categorisation, SEBI classified all current and upcoming mutual fund schemes into five main groups: equity funds, debt funds, hybrid funds, solution-oriented funds, and other funds, including ETFs and FOFs. These groups are further divided into 39 mutual fund scheme categories available in the market. Reasons Behind the Mutual Fund Recategorisation SEBI aims to standardise the functioning of Asset Management Companies (AMCs) by introducing mutual fund categorisation rules. The move seeks to eliminate confusion caused by misleading scheme names. The new regulations require AMCs to define names clearly based on fund objectives and asset allocation. This ensures transparency for investors, facilitating easier product comparison and selection. Additionally, the rules establish a framework for fund managers to maintain focus on specific objectives, discouraging frequent changes. What Are the Rules for Mutual Fund Recategorisation? SEBI has implemented changes in mutual fund categorisation to provide investors with clearer options. The new rules include: Enhanced Classification: SEBI now clearly defines asset allocation, investment mandate, and risk profiles for mutual fund schemes. Categories include Equity, Debt, Hybrid, Solution Oriented, and Others. Scheme Renaming: Schemes must be renamed to reflect their risk profiles, removing misleading adjectives like "opportunity" or "advantage" that may attract investors without a thorough risk analysis. Introduction of Lock-in Period: Certain solution-oriented schemes, like retirement and children's funds, may have a lock-in period introduced by SEBI to align with their objectives. Existing investors may not be affected by this change. Changes to Scheme Attributes: Fund houses are mandated to redefine the investment mandate, strategy, and benchmark against which fund performance will be evaluated. These new SEBI rules necessitate Asset Management Companies (AMCs) to realign their offerings in line with the updated norms, providing investors with increased transparency and clarity. Equity Schemes Equity schemes are divided into 12 different categories, primarily investing in stocks. Large, mid and small-cap stocks define the investment universe based on the scheme's mandate. The equity funds can be further expanded on the basis of the sector/theme and investing strategy of the fund. Debt Schemes Debt schemes offer 16 categories: investing in the money market or debt securities. Money market securities include commercial papers, certificates of deposits, and treasury bills, while debt market securities include government securities, PSU bonds, and non-convertible debts. Sub-categories are based on the nature of investments and their maturity period. Hybrid Schemes Hybrid schemes are a blend of equity and debt funds. Hybrid schemes have seven categories to invest in. Aggressive Hybrid Funds have the highest exposure to equities, while debt-oriented hybrid funds (Conservative Hybrid Funds) have the least exposure to debt instruments. Know more about the structure of Hybrid schemes in the table listed below. Solution-oriented Schemes Solutions-oriented schemes include Retirement Funds and Children’s Funds. These are open-ended funds with a minimum lock-in period of 5 years or until retirement age (for Retirement Funds) and/or until the child reaches the age of majority (for Children’s Funds). Other Schemes Other Schemes consist of two sub-categories – Index Funds/ETFs and Fund of Funds (FoFs). Index Funds/ETFs invest 95% of the assets in securities of a specific index. Fund of Funds also invests a minimum of 95% in underlying funds. FoFs are of two types – Domestic and Overseas.
