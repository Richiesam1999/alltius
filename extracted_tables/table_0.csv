"What is the overall 
deductible?","$2,500/individual or $5,000/family","Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this 
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must 
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all 
family members meets the overall family deductible."
"Are there services 
covered before you meet 
your deductible?","Yes. Preventive care services are 
covered before you meet your 
deductible.","This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.

services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered 
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/."

overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met."
